{"loans":[{"id":436753,"name":"Pheap's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a wooden house, Pheap is aged 37 and married. She has five dependent children, two daughters and three sons, who are still in school. Pheap and her husband earn a living through farming rice and planting cassava. Having been in this business for almost ten years, she is able to earn around 11,000KHR per day to support her family. The drop in cassava price is still a main challenge for her business. \r\n\r\nPheap has been with VisionFund for two loan cycles and she has completely paid back the loans, which have enabled her to better support her family and her children\u2019s studies. Now she and her group members, who have been with VisionFund for four cycles, are applying for another loan. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizers for her farmland and she will use a portion of the funds to pay for labor costs. She hopes this loan will enable her to prosper in her business and increase her family\u2019s income so as to keep her children in school until they are finished.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"image":{"id":1115685,"template_id":1},"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers for her farmland.","location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":800,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pheap","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phoeun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3200000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
